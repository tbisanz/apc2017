(from M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999)

After compiling and testing that refactoring, I did the same for 
frequentRenterPoints.

It is worth stopping to think a bit about the last refactoring. Most
refactorings reduce the amount of code, but this one increases
it. That's because C++ requires a lot of statements to set up a
summing loop. Even a simple summing loop with one line of code per
element needs 4-6 lines of support around it. It's an idiom that is
obvious to any programmer but is a lot of lines all the same.

The other concern with this refactoring lies in performance. The old
code executed the "for" loop once, the new code executes it three
times. A for loop that takes a long time might impair
performance. Many programmers would not do this refactoring simply for
this reason. But note the words if and might. Until I profile I cannot
tell how much time is needed for the loop to calculate or whether the
loop is called often enough for it to affect the overall performance
of the system. Don't worry about this while refactoring. When you
optimize you will have to worry about it, but you will be in a much
better position to do something about it, and you will have more
options to optimize effectively.

These queries are now available for any code written in the customer
class. They can easily be added to the interface of the class should
other parts of the system need this information. Without queries like
these, other methods have to deal with knowing about the rentals and
building the loops. In a complex system, that will lead to much more
code to write and mantain.
