Decomposing and Redistributing the Statement Method

(from M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999)

The obvious first target of my attention is the overly long statement
method. When I look at a long method like that, I am looking to
decompose the method into smaller pieces. Smaller pieces of code tend
to make things more manageable. They are easier to work with and move
around.

The first phase of refactorings in this chapter show how I split up
the long method and move the pieces to better classes. My aim is to
make it easier to write an HTML statement method with much less
duplication of code.

My first step is to find a logical clump of code and use Extract
Method. An obvious piece here is the switch statement. This
looks like it would make a good chunk to extract into its own method.

When I extract a method, as in any refactoring, I need to know what
can go wrong. If I do the extraction badly, I could introduce a bug
into the program. So before I do the refactoring I need to figure out
how to do it safely. I've done this refactoring a few times before, so
I've written down the safe steps in the catalog.

First I need to look in the fragment for any variables that are local
in scope to the method we are looking at, the local variables and
parameters. This segment of code uses two: each and thisAmount. Of
these each is not modified by the code but thisAmount is modified. Any
non-modified variable I can pass in as a parameter. Modified variables
need more care. If there is only one, I can return it. The temp is
initialized to 0 each time around the loop and is not altered until
the switch gets to it. So I can just assign the result.
