As I look at amountFor, I can see that it uses information from the
rental, but does not use information from the customer.

This immediately raises my suspicions that the method is on the wrong
object. In most cases a method should be on the object whose data it
uses, thus the method should be moved to the rental. To do this I use
Move Method. With this you first copy the code over to the
rental, adjust it to fit in its new home, and compile.

In this case fitting into its home means removing the parameter. I
also renamed the method as I did the move.

I can now test to see whether the method works. To do this I replace
the body of Customer::amountFor to delegate to the new method.

    // Customer.cpp
    ...
    double Customer::
    amountFor( const Rental& aRental ) const
    {
      return aRental.getCharge();
    }
     

I can now compile and test to see whether I've broken anything.

The next step is to find every reference to the old method and adjust
the reference to use the new method, as follows.

In this case this step is easy because we just created the method and
it is in only one place. In general, however, you need to do a "find"
across all the classes that might be using that method.

When I've made the change, the next thing is to remove the old
method. The compiler should tell me whether I missed anything. I then
test to see if I've broken anything.

Sometimes I leave the old method to delegate to the new method. This
is useful if it is a public method and I don't want to change the
interface of the other class.

There is certainly some more I would like to do to Rental::getCharge
but I will leave it for the moment and return to Customer::statement.
