(from M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999)

Once it is moved I can start using Replace Conditional with
Polymorphism.

I do this by taking one leg of the case statement at time and creating
an overriding method. I start with RegularPrice.

This overrides the parent case statement, which I just leave as it
is. I compile and test for this case then take the next leg, compile
and test. (To make sure I'm executing the subclass code, I like to
throw in a deliberate bug and run it to ensure the tests blow up. Not
that I'm paranoid or anything.)

When I've done that with all the legs, I make Price::getCharge a pure virtual 
function.
