The First Step in Refactoring

(from M. Fowler, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1999)

Whenever I do refactoring, the first step is always the same. I need
to build a solid set of tests for that section of code. The tests are
essential because even though I follow refactorings structured to
avoid most of the opportunities for introducing bugs, I'm still human
and still make mistakes. Thus I need solid tests.

Because the statement result produces a string, I create a few
customers, give each customer a few rentals of various kinds of films,
and generate the statement strings. I then do a string comparison
between the new string and some reference strings that I have hand
checked. I set up all of these tests so I can run them from one
command on the command line. The tests take only a few seconds to run,
and as you will see, I run them often.

An important part of these tests is the way they report their
results. They either say "OK", meaning that all the strings are
identical to the reference strings, or they print a list of failures:
lines that turned out differently. The tests are thus
self-checking. It is vital to make tests self-checking. If you don't,
you end up spending time hand checking some numbers from the test
against some numbers of a desk pad, and that slows you down.

As we do the refactoring, we will lean on the tests. I'm going to be
relying on the tests to tell me whether I introduce a bug. It is
essential for refactoring that you have good tests. It's worth
spending the time to build the tests, because the tests give you the
security you need to change the program later. This is such an
important part of refactoring that I go into more detail on testing in
Chapter 4.

Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of
tests. These tests must be self-checking.
